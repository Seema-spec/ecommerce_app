# Movie List Application

This is a React application that displays a list of movies and their details. It allows users to search for movies and view additional information about each movie.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd movie-list-app`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open your web browser and visit: `http://localhost:3000`

## Elements Demonstrating Proficiency

1. **Component Modularity**: The application is structured using reusable React components, promoting code organization and maintainability.

2. **State Management**: Utilized React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` for managing component state and fetching data asynchronously.

3. **API Integration**: Demonstrated API integration by fetching movie data from a mock `MovieService`, simulating API calls.

## Potential Improvements (with 4 More Hours)

1. **Styling**: Enhance the visual appeal and responsiveness of the application using CSS and/or a CSS framework.

2. **Error Handling**: Implement better error handling and user feedback for cases like API errors or empty search results.

3. **Pagination**: Add pagination support for movie list to improve performance and user experience with large datasets.

4. **Detailed Movie View**: Create a separate view to display detailed information about a selected movie.
